## Introduction
The core of the project is to make the HPC democratisable for [Imaging](https://imaging.wehi.edu.au/) researchers at WEHI. The project aims to propose a user friendly and easily accessible workflow for analysing 3D Lightsheet Image data using Milton HPC. It also include a detailed analysis for the platforms Galaxy and Nextflow.


For students in this project, follow these steps to get started:

1. Finish university mandatory modules for the internship placement
2. Set up WEHI workday & finish mandatory modules and courses
3. Finish [Onboarding Checklist](https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/StudentInternGroupatWEHI/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FStudentInternGroupatWEHI%2FShared%20Documents%2FImage%20Introduction%2FRDM%230138%20%5BDraft%5D%20Student%20Internship%20Onboarding%20checklist%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FStudentInternGroupatWEHI%2FShared%20Documents%2FImage%20Introduction)
4. Read [Onboarding Document](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/RDM_0138_RCP_Student_Onboarding_Checklist/23280815)

## Getting Started

This project work with data produced by [3D Lightsheet Microscopy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afIkWHx3duc). The [presentation of previous students](https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/StudentInternGroupatWEHI/Shared%20Documents/Image%20Introduction/Imaging%20-%20Dingcheng%20Lu,%20Cassiel%20Huo,%20Starry%20Liu-20230525_110436-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=TTs5gC) can be accessed via Teams. The [Napri Lattice Plugin](https://github.com/BioimageAnalysisCoreWEHI/napari_lattice) can serve as an example. This is an example [workflow](https://github.com/BioimageAnalysisCoreWEHI/napari_lattice/wiki/5.1-Workflows-(Custom-workflow)) and [dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/7117784).

## Milton HPC
Milton is the HPC used at WEHI.

## Galaxy
Galaxy is an open-source, web-based platform that provides a user-friendly environment for performing data analysis, particularly in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology. It was developed to make complex computational tools and workflows more accessible to researchers who may not have extensive programming experience.

Key features of Galaxy include: 
- Web-based Interface: Galaxy is accessible through a web browser, eliminating the need for complex installations on individual computers. This feature allows users to access the platform from anywhere with an internet connection. 
- Reproducible Workflows: Galaxy allows users to create and share workflows, which are sequences of computational steps. These workflows can be saved, shared, and reused by other researchers, ensuring the reproducibility of data analysis. 
- Tool Integration: Galaxy provides a wide range of computational tools and algorithms for various bioinformatics tasks, such as sequence analysis, genome assembly, protein structure prediction, and more. These tools are integrated into the platform and can be combined to create custom analysis workflows. 
- Data Management: Galaxy includes features for uploading, organizing, and managing data within the platform. This ensures that data used in analyses is readily available and can be easily shared with collaborators. 
- Collaboration: Galaxy allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously, facilitating collaboration and enabling researchers to share their analysis processes and results with others. 
- Visualization: Galaxy provides interactive visualizations and charts to help users interpret and analyze their data effectively.

Getting Started: \
First, [Install](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/get-galaxy/) Galaxy. Follow [this tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/imaging/tutorials/imaging-introduction/tutorial.html) to tart using Galaxy for image analysis. Visit [Galaxy Documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/#about-docs) as you need.
